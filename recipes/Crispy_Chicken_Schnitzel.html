    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs, honey, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, and garlic together in a
        bowl. Mix bread crumbs, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 to 1 inch of vegetable oil in a heavy skillet to 350 degrees F
        (175 degrees C). You can also use a deep fryer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put chicken slices in the egg mixture and knead until fully coated.
        Press chicken in the bread crumbs until evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches, carefully place chicken in the hot oil using tongs
        and cook until no longer pink in the center and browned on the outside,
        3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and serve with lemon
        wedges.
