    <h3>so simple, yet so delicious</h3>

    <p>
      With a salty, flavorful crust and juicy, tender meat in the center, these
      crispy breaded pork chops remind me of my grandmother's…
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfect comfort meal when served with mashed potatoes and green beans.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray.</li>
      <li>2 large eggs.</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water.</li>
      <li>1 cup seasoned bread crumbs.</li>
      <li>4 (5 ounce) bone-in, center-cut pork chops.</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt.</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper.</li>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Recipe Steps</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly coat a wire
        rack with cooking spray and set in a rimmed baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs and water together in a shallow dish. Place bread crumbs in a
        second shallow dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season pork chops evenly with salt and pepper. Dip and coat chops in
        egg, allow excess to drip off, then dip in bread crumbs until well
        coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 2
        chops in the skillet and cook until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes.
        Flip and cook until crisp on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more.
        Transfer to the prepared rack. Heat remaining oil in the skillet and
        repeat to sear remaining chops
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake pork chops in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 10
        to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
        should read 155 degrees F (68 degrees C).
